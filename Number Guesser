# so they can do it in a reasonable number of guesses

#We'll assume that the number will start at 0 and then we'll ask to type a number as the top bound that we'll generate

#After we get out of the loop, we'll gonna tell the user how many guesses they used to guess

#will automatically add spaces in between them.

#In our case we didn't have to turn guesses to a string, that's beacuse the print statement is smart enough to understand
#that it is an int and it will turn it to a string for us
#The above print line with commas, it's the same thing as doing this: print("You got it in" + str(guesses) + " guesses.")
